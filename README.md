   **About Movie List**
    
**Movie List** is a dynamic web application designed to help users explore a vast collection of movies. Using TMDB (The Movie Database) API, the application provides users with access to detailed movie information.

This project enhances my skills in web development, particularly focusing on the integration of APIs, server-side rendering with EJS, and the use of Express.js for building scalable web applications.

**Key Features:**

  * Movie Exploration: Easily browse through a list of popular movies and discover new films.
    
  * Search Functionality: Quickly find specific movies by title using the search bar
    
  * Detailed Information: Click on any movie to retrieve a detailed JSON response containing in-depth information about the movie.
    
  * Responsive Design: The application is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
  
This project serves as a hands-on example of integrating third-party APIs into a Node.js application, demonstrating how to fetch, process, and display data dynamically on a web page. The focus on clean code, modular architecture, and user-friendly design makes it a valuable resource for anyone interested in modern web development practices.
